# Day 2

## Part One

This time I tried using the language from the puzzle prompt to guide the assistant. I was able to get the correct answer with two messages.

Chat history:
```
1. User: Shared the puzzle input format and example data
2. Assistant: Implemented the solution checking for safe reports according to the rules:
   - All levels must be either increasing or decreasing
   - Adjacent levels must differ by at least 1 and at most 3
3. User: Accepted the solution which correctly identified 2 safe reports
```

Key observations:
- Clear rules made implementation straightforward
- Test-driven development with example data
- Solution used simple integer comparisons and direction tracking

## Part Two

Chat history:
```
1. User: Added part two requirements for Problem Dampener
2. Assistant: Extended solution to check if removing any single level makes a report safe
3. User: Accepted the solution which correctly identified 4 safe reports
```

Key observations:
- Reused existing `isSafe` function
- Added `canBeMadeSafe` to try removing each level
- Efficient implementation using single reusable slice
- Test case verified both original safe reports and newly safe reports with Problem Dampener

## Solution Evolution
Document any significant changes or improvements:
- Started with test cases from puzzle examples
- Implemented Part 1 with safety checking rules
- Added Part 2 with Problem Dampener logic

## Learnings
- What worked well:
  - Clear problem description led to straightforward implementation
  - Test-driven approach helped catch edge cases
  - Reusing existing functions for Part 2
- Ideas for future improvements:
  - Could potentially optimize by checking most likely problematic levels first
  - Might benefit from parallel processing for large inputs

## Time Analysis
- Time spent on prompt engineering: ~3 minutes
- Time spent on implementation: ~10 minutes
- Comparison: Similar to traditional programming approach due to clear requirements

## Code Stats
- Lines of code: ~100 lines
- Number of prompts needed: 2 total (1 for each part)
- Number of iterations to solution: 1 (implementations worked first try with test cases)
