# Advent of Code 2024 - AI edition

I'm using this year's Advent of Code challenges to practice my AI prompt engineering skills.

I'll be doing some simple setup of each day's challenge and then chatting with the assistant to solve the puzzle.

In each `dayXX` folder, you'll find a few files:

- `puzzle.md` file that contains the puzzle prompt for that day.
- `input` file that contains the puzzle input for that day.
- `main.go` file that contains the code generated by the assistant.
- `prompts.md` file that contains the chat history for that day's challenge.
