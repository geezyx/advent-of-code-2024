# Day 4

## Part 1

Chat history:
```
1. User: Shared puzzle description and example input
2. Assistant: Created test file with example input and expected result (18)
3. User: Accepted test file
4. Assistant: Implemented solution for Part 1 using directional search
5. User: Verified solution works
```

Key observations:
- Used 2D grid representation for word search
- Implemented directional search in 8 directions
- Handled boundary checks and validation
- Solution referenced in:
```
startLine: 28
endLine: 85
```

## Part 2

Chat history:
```
1. User: Added part 2 puzzle description
2. Assistant: Updated test file with separate test cases for part 1 and 2
3. User: Fixed incorrect test input
4. Assistant: Implemented X-MAS pattern detection
5. User: Helped fix pattern validation logic
```

Key observations:
- X-MAS patterns require two diagonal MAS/SAM strings
- Center must be 'A'
- Valid patterns shown in comments:
```
M . S    S . M    M . M    S . S
. A .    . A .    . A .    . A .
M . S    S . M    S . S    M . M
```

Final solution referenced in:
```
startLine: 87
endLine: 132
```

## Learnings
- What worked well:
  - Separating test cases for part 1 and 2
  - Clear pattern visualization in comments
  - Early validation checks for performance
- Ideas for future improvements:
  - Could potentially cache results for overlapping patterns
  - Might benefit from more descriptive error messages

## Time Analysis
- Time spent on prompt engineering: ~5 minutes
- Time spent on implementation: ~15 minutes
- Additional time fixing pattern validation: ~10 minutes

## Code Stats
- Lines of code: ~200 lines
- Number of prompts needed: 5 total
- Number of iterations to solution: 3 (main implementation + 2 fixes)
