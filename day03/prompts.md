# Day 3

I was curious if the assistant could solve the puzzle directly, so I gave it the exact puzzle prompt from day 3. Initially it generated a python solution, so I asked it to switch to go and read the puzzle input from the file. The solution worked on the first try!

Here's how the assistant described how it solved the puzzle:
> For Day 3, we used regular expressions to parse the corrupted memory input and find valid multiplication instructions.

> Part 1 focused on finding valid mul(X,Y) instructions where X and Y are 1-3 digit numbers. We used a regex pattern `mul\((\d{1,3}),(\d{1,3})\)` to match these instructions and ignore any invalid/corrupted ones. For each valid instruction found, we multiplied the numbers and added the result to a running total.

> For Part 2, we extended the solution to handle conditional do() and don't() instructions that enable/disable multiplication instructions. We used a combined regex pattern to match both mul() and conditional instructions, then processed them in order while tracking the enabled state. Only multiplications that occurred while enabled contributed to the total.

> The key aspects of the solution were:
> 1. Using regex to parse the corrupted input and extract valid instructions
> 2. Carefully handling the numeric constraints (1-3 digits)
> 3. Maintaining state for Part 2 to track whether multiplications were enabled
> 4. Processing instructions sequentially to respect the order of do/don't conditions

> The solution successfully found both answers:
> - Part 1: 166,905,464 (sum of all valid multiplications)
> - Part 2: 72,948,684 (sum of only enabled multiplications)

## Notes

The assistant is leaving out that the first solution it suggested for part 2 had a bug in it. I said: "there is a bug in your code, it output 0 which was the incorrect answer" and it responded with:

> The issue is likely in how we're searching for instructions. Let's modify the code to process the instructions in order of appearance, rather than searching for each type separately. Here's the fixed version:

And it supplied the working code for part 2.

This isn't fun anymore it's too easy...
