# Day 1

## Part 1

Chat history:
```
1. User: Shared code snippets and asked me to follow certain instructions for responses
2. User: Shared example data for part 1 of the puzzle and referenced puzzle.md
3. Assistant: Provided an update to the test file (day01/solution_test.go)
4. User: Accepted the test file update and asked me to solve part 1 of the puzzle
5. Assistant: Provided the solution implementation for Part 1 in solution.go
6. User: Accepted the solution.go changes
```

Key observations:
- Test-driven approach with example data from puzzle.md
- Solution involved sorting and calculating total distance
- Clear instructions and examples facilitated straightforward implementation

## Part 2

Chat history:
```
1. User: Asked me to solve day01 part 2
2. Assistant: Implemented frequency map solution for similarity score
3. User: Accepted the solution.go changes
```

Key observations:
- Reused input parsing logic from part 1
- Frequency map efficiently calculated similarity score
- Test case verified correct implementation

## Solution Evolution
Initial approach:
- Started with test cases from puzzle examples
- Implemented Part 1 with sorting and distance calculation
- Added Part 2 using frequency map for counting

Reference implementation can be found in:

```go:day01/solution.go
startLine: 30
endLine: 75
```
for Part 1, and:

```go:day01/solution.go
startLine: 85
endLine: 111
```
for Part 2.

## Learnings
- What worked well:
  - Starting with test cases from puzzle examples
  - Clear problem description led to straightforward implementation
  - Using appropriate data structures (slices for sorting, maps for counting)
- Ideas for future improvements:
  - Could potentially combine both parts into a single pass through the input
  - Might benefit from more robust error handling

## Time Analysis
- Time spent on prompt engineering: ~2 minutes
- Time spent on implementation: ~8 minutes
- Test-driven approach helped ensure correct implementation

## Code Stats
- Lines of code: ~80 lines
- Number of prompts needed: 2 total (1 for each part)
- Number of iterations to solution: 1 (implementations worked first try with test cases)
